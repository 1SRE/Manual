{"06. Code Management": {"What is Git?.md": "<h1 align=\"center\">What is Git?</h1></center>\n\nDirectly from [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/)\n> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.\n\nHonestly, I don't plan on adding much to this subfolder. I use Git 99.9% of the time at work and most of the commands are muscle memory at this point; however, there are still some commands I simply don't use b/c I never found them to be useful (i.e.: `git rebase`)\n\n[Cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)"}, "02. Operating Systems": {"01. Linux": {"03. Boot Sequence.md": "<h1 align=\"center\">Boot sequence</h1></center>\n\nstuff", "01. What is Linux?.md": "<h1 align=\"center\">What is Linux?</h1></center>\n\n- Open source\n- In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and the same types of software you are accustomed to, such as word processors, photo editors, video editors, and so on. In many cases, a software\u2019s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. In short: if you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux. [credit](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)\n\n- But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and\u2014for users with the appropriate skills\u2014to contribute to. [credit](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)\n\n- Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components. [credit](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)\n\n# Unix vs Linux?\nI've heard of both Unix and Linux, so what the heck is the difference and why are they brought up?\n- Linux is an open-source operating system. This OS is supported on several computer platforms and includes multiple software features that handle computer resources, and allow you to do tasks. This operating system was launched by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991.

It allows the user to perform specific functions. This operating system was launched in 1960, and was released by AT&T Bell Labs. [credit](https://byjus.com/gate/difference-between-unix-and-linux/#:~:text=Basic%20Definition-,Linux%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource%20operating%20system.,the%20user%20and%20the%20computer.)\n\nAlas, there's nothing to really be concerned about. Just remember: [Linux refers to the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system. More generally, it refers to the family of derived distributions](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/unix-vs-linux/#Difference_Between_Unix_and_Linux) and [Unix refers to the original operating system developed by AT&T. More generally, it refers to family of derived operating systems.](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/unix-vs-linux/#Difference_Between_Unix_and_Linux)\n\nLinux was designed considering UNIX compatability; it's functionality list is quite similar to that of UNIX [credit](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)", "02. Linux architecture.md": "<h1 align=\"center\">Linux Architecture</h1></center>\n\nYou can break the Linux system architecture into several components; however, the main ones are: hardware, kernel, system libraries, system utilities, desktop environment, and applications layer.\n\n- Hardware layer\n    - Represents the physical hardware components of the computer such as the CPU, memory, and storage.\n- Kernel layer\n    - The kernel is one of the major sections of an OS (operating system). It's responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS; the kernel facilitates required abstraction for hiding details of low-level hardware or application programs to the system [credit](https://www.javatpoint.com/architecture-of-linux). Below are some important kernel types which will be referred to later\n        - Monolithic kernel\n        - Micro kernels\n        - Exo kernels\n        - Hybrid kernels\n        - Nano kernels\n    - Ultimately, the kernel is what interacts between the barebone hardware and the rest of the applications found on the OS\n- System libraries layer\n    - These libraries include system calls which invoke kernel functions as well as other functionst hat perform tasks such as file manipulation, networking, and memory management [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)\n- System utilities layer\n    - Set of programs that perform various system-level tasks such as managing processes, controlling users accounts, and configuring system settings. These utilities are command-line programs that are ran by the user or by other programs\n- Desktop environment layer (OPTIONAL)\n    - This is optional because it's not available everything (for example, there's the general Ubuntu ISO and there's a Ubuntu server ISO which doesn't have GUI access.. the server is all command-line focused where as the former is an image that you can interact with more physically such as clicking on items)\n- Applications layer\n    - Topmost layer of the Linux architecture and consists of the software or other applications (i.e.: Google Chrome, VS Code, Docker)\n\n![img](https://static.javatpoint.com/linux/images/architecture-of-linux.png)\n\n\n## Hardware Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - This is the bottommost layer of the Linux architecture and represents the physical hardware components of the computer, such as the processor, memory, and storage. The hardware layer is responsible for interacting with the various hardware devices and providing access to them for the rest of the operating system. [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)\n    - Barebones!\n\n## Kernel Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - The Linux\u00ae kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer\u2019s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible. The kernel is so named because\u2014like a seed inside a hard shell\u2014it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it\u2019s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer. [credit](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel)\n\nThe kernel has four jobs [credit](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel)\n- Memory management\n    - Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and where\n- Process management\n    - Determine which processes can use the central processing unit (CPU), when, and for how long\n- Device drivers\n    - Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes\n- System calls & Security\n    - Receive requests for service from the processes\n\nThe main difference between the types of kernels is the number of address spaces they support\n- Micro kernels\n    - Microkernels have all of their services in the kernel address space. For their communication protocol, microkernels use message passing, which sends data packets, signals and functions to the correct processes. Microkernels also provide greater flexibility than monolithic kernels; to add a new service, admins modify the user address space for a microkernel. Because of their isolated nature, microkernels are more secure than monolithic kernels. They remain unaffected if one service within the address space fails [credit](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/kernel)\n- Monolithic kernel\n    - Monolithic kernels are larger than microkernels, because they house both kernel and user services in the same address space. Monolithic kernels use a faster system call communication protocol than microkernels to execute processes between the hardware and software. They are less flexible than microkernels and require more work; admins must reconstruct the entire kernel to support a new service. Monolithic kernels pose a greater security risk to systems than microkernels because, if a service fails, then the entire system shuts down. Monolithic kernels also don't require as much source code as a microkernel, which means they are less susceptible to bugs and need less debugging. [credit](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/kernel)\n- Hybrid kernels\n    - Hybrid kernel is a kernel architecture based on a combination of microkernel and monolithic kernel architecture used in computer operating systems. This kernel approach combines the speed and simpler design of monolithic kernel with the modularity and execution safety of microkernel. A hybrid kernel runs some services in the kernel space to reduce the performance overhead of a traditional microkernel, while still running kernel code as servers in the user space. For instance, a hybrid kernel design may keep the virtual files system and bus controllers inside the kernel and the file system drivers and storage drivers as user mode programs outside the kernel. Such a design keeps the performance and design principles of a monolithic kernel. [credit](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27004/hybrid-kernel)\n- Nano kernels\n    - A nanokernel is a small kernel that offers hardware abstraction, but without system services. Larger kernels are designed to offer more features and manage more hardware abstraction. Modern microkernels lack system services as well, hence, the terms microkernal and nanokernal have become analogous. [credit](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27005/nano-kernel)\n- Exo kernels\n    - Exokernel is a type of operating system developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that seeks to provide application-level management of hardware resources. The exokernel architecture is designed to separate resource protection from management to facilitate application-specific customization.\n\n## System Libraries Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - This layer consists of a set of libraries that provide functions for the applications to use. These libraries include system calls, which are used to invoke kernel functions, as well as other functions that perform tasks such as file manipulation, networking, and memory management. [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)\n\n## System Utilities Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - This layer consists of a set of programs that perform various system-level tasks, such as managing processes, controlling user accounts, and configuring system settings. These utilities are usually command-line programs that are invoked by the user or by other programs. [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)\n\n## Desktop Environment Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - This layer is optional and is not present on all Linux systems. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the operating system using a mouse and keyboard. The most common desktop environments in Linux are Gnome, KDE, and Xfce. [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)\n\n## Application Layer - In depth\n- Overview\n    - This is the topmost layer of the Linux architecture and consists of the various applications that run on the operating system. These can be anything from productivity software and games to web browsers and media players. [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)"}, "02. Windows": {"01.

Sure, it's possible to find manuals that cover each of these topics in depth by simply Googling them, but the purpose of 1SRE is to combine everything and spit it out onto one <i>source of truth</i>.\n\nIf anything, at the end of the day, the platform is truly meant for myself. My kind of work revolves around reilability engineering and I'm typically learning more things as I go; one day, I thought to myself that it'd be nice to have a little website to go back to whenever I needed the information (either for work or for general interview prep)...\n\nIf you find anything that needs to be corrected, please submit a PR request and I'll look at it when I get the chance. Whatever I write about is through experience or research, but I know with technology constantly changing, there's always a better or efficient approach to a problem or question.\n\nLastly, thank you so much for giving this a read.
