# Questions
- Q: Installing packages
    - A: sudo apt-get install <pckgName>

- Q: Uninstalling packages
    - A: sudo apt remove <pckgName>

- Q: Updating your Ubuntu repositories
    - A: sudo apt update

- Q: Updating a all packages
    - A: sudo apt upgrade

- Q: What is a DNS?
    - A: Domain name system, like the phone book of the internet of domains (all domains have an ip, blah blah)

- Q: OSI Mode - The OSI model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network
    - Application layer
    - Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services

    - Presentation Layer
    - Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs

    - Session Layer
    - Maintains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions

    - Transport Layer
    - Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP and UDP

    - Network Layer
    - Decies which physical path the data will take

    - Data Link Layer
    - Defines the format of data on the network

    - Physical layer
    - Transmits raw bit stream over the physical medium

- Q: What to do if you can't successfully SSH to a server
    
    A: In order to estbalish an SSH connection, you need both a client and the corresponding server-side component. An SSH client is an application you install on teh computer which you'll use to connect (SSH) to another server or computer

    On the server side, there is a component called an SSH Daemon (Demon) which is constantly listening to a specific TCP/IP port for possible client connection requests.

    When you make a connection through a SSH call/request, both the client and the server are exchanging information (identification data)
    - if credentials are correct then it'll encrypt the connection between the two

    fun fact: default SSH protocol version for SSH server and SSH client communication is version 2

    STEPS:
    1. We need to make sure both clients have OpenSSH
        1. OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol. It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.
    2. Verify that the SSH service is running on both the client and the server
        1. sudo service ssh status
        2. If not running, restart it (sudo systemctl restart ssh)
    3. Thhere could be a cance that SSH daemon (demon) configuration file is messed up so compare it with the base model of it (sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
        1. Any changes require a ssh restrat (sudo service ssh restart)
    4. Sometimes you'll need the port number (ssh user@ip -p<nmm>)
    5. Run SSH with more verbosity (ssh -vvv username@host)
        1. Basically look at the logs in /var/log/auth.log (look for messages that contain sshd)

# NETWORK PROTOCOLS (TCP & UDP)

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    - Connection-oriented meaning once a connection has been established, data can be transmitted in two directions
    - Perfect protocol for transferring images, data files, and web pages
    - TCP is SLOWER than UDP
    - More overhead = more space
    - TCP provides an ordered delivery of data from user to server (and vice versa)
    - Data sequencing: possible!
    - Optimal use: HTTPS, HTTP, SMTP, POP, FTP
    - Stream type: byte stream

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
    - Connectionless protocol
    - No overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection; data is continiously sent regardless of if it's being received successfuly or not
    - Preferred for real-time communications like broadcast or multitask network transmission (so think real-time chatting over the internet)
    - UDP is FASTER than TCP
    - Less overhead = less space
    - UDP is not dedicated to end-to-end communications, nor does it check the readienss of the receiver
    - Data sequencing: not possible!
    - Optimal use: video conferencing, streaming, DNS, VoIP
    - Stream type: message stream

# NETWORK VIRTUALIZATION
- Abstracting network resources that were traditionally delivered in hardware to software. NV can combine multiple physical networks to one virtual, software-based network, or it can divide one physical network into separate, independent virtual networks.
- Network virtualization software allows network administrators to move virtual machines across different domains without reconfiguring the network. The software creates a network overlay that can run separate virtual network layers on top of the same physical network fabric
