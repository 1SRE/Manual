## Training
If possible, please get your training straight from Red Hat as opposed to utilizing a third party-- this is assuming you're okay with virtual self-paced training; it's easier on a company's training budget.

You can find more information about it [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/learning-subscription). If possible, go for the premium option.

If you're fine with virtual self-paced training, this approach of training alongside RH makes the most sense and has the best bang for the buck. As opposed to paying $4000 for one RHCSA week-long training, you have access to all of the trainings provided by Red Hat for $9000-- and all the training + tests is up to **you** (don't forget about the free retakes)!

## Notice
All of the content found in this subfolder is either work that I completed during the RHCSA training or training material given to me; I do not plan on updating any of the files moving forward past the RHCSA certification.
