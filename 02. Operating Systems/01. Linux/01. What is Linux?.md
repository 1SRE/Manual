<h1 align="center">What is Linux?</h1></center>

- Open source
- In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, macOS (formerly OS X), or iOS. Like other operating systems, Linux has a graphical interface, and the same types of software you are accustomed to, such as word processors, photo editors, video editors, and so on. In many cases, a software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other systems. In short: if you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

- But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to. [credit](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)

- Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and other user-interface components. [credit](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)

# Unix vs Linux?
I've heard of both Unix and Linux, so what the heck is the difference and why are they brought up?
- Linux is an open-source operating system. This OS is supported on several computer platforms and includes multiple software features that handle computer resources, and allow you to do tasks. This operating system was launched by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki in 1991.

- Unix is a powerful and multitasking operating system that behaves like a bridge between the user and the computer. It allows the user to perform specific functions. This operating system was launched in 1960, and was released by AT&T Bell Labs.

Alas, there's nothing to really be concerned about. Just remember: [Linux refers to the kernel of the GNU/Linux operating system. More generally, it refers to the family of derived distributions](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/unix-vs-linux/#Difference_Between_Unix_and_Linux) and [Unix refers to the original operating system developed by AT&T. More generally, it refers to family of derived operating systems.](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/unix-vs-linux/#Difference_Between_Unix_and_Linux)

Linux was designed considering UNIX compatability; it's functionality list is quite similar to that of UNIX [credit](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_linux.htm)
