<h1 align="center">Boot sequence</h1></center>

There are 6 distinct stages in a typical Linux boot process:

1. BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
2. MBR (Master Boot Record)
3. GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader)
4. Kernel
5. Init
6. Runlevel programs

Below is a detailed description of each stage [credit](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-linux-booting-process-6-steps-described-in-detail/)
1. BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) - **INDEPENDENT OF OS, HAPPENS ON EVERY OS**
    - The BIOS loads and executes the MBR
    - When you first turn on your computer, the BIOS performs some integrity checks for the HDD (hard-disk drive) or SSD (solid-state drive)
    - BIOS runs from ROM (read only memory) which comes from the motherboard
    - Next, the BIOS searches for, loads, and executes the boot loader program which is found in the MBR (often on a USB stick, CD-ROM, or HDD/SSD)
    - Once the boot loader is detected, it's loaded into memory and the BIOS gives control to the system

    Example of BIOS

2. MBR (Master Boot Record)
    - Responsible for loading and executing the GRUB boot loader
    - 
    - The MBR is located in the 1st sector of the bootable disk, which is typically `/dev/hda` or `/dev/sda` depending on the hardware. It also contains information about the GRUB
3. GRUB (GNU GRand Unified Bootloader)
    - This is the typical boot loader for most modern Linux systems
    - GRUB will run in RAM (random access memory)
    - The GRUB splash screen is often the first thing you see when you boot your computer. It has a simple menu where you can select some options. If you have multiple kernel images installed, you can use your keyboard to select the one you want your system to boot with. By default, the latest kernel image is selected.
    - Example:
        - If you dual boot your system (two OS such as RHEL9 and Windows 10), the GRUB menu will give you the option of choosing either RHEL9 or Windows 10
    - The splash screen will wait a few seconds for you to select and option. If you don't, it will load the default kernel image.
    - In many systems you can find the GRUB configuration file at `/boot/grub/grub.conf` or `/etc/grub.conf`
    - Main purpose of GRUB is to load kernel into RAM (memory)

4. Kernel
    - Core of any OS
    - In this stage of the boot process, the kernel that was selected by GRUB first mounts the root file system that's specified in the `grub.conf` file. Then it executes the `/sbin/init program`, which is always the first program to be executed. You can confirm this with its process id (PID), which should always be 1.
    - The kernel then establishes a temporary root file system using Initial RAM Disk (initrd) until the real file system is mounted.
5. Init (Initilization) [credit](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/02/linux-boot-process/)
    - Parent process (`ps -aux`).. you'll see it has a PID of 1
    - At this point, your system executes runlevel programs. At one point it would look for an init file, usually found at `/etc/inittab` to decide the Linux run level.
    - Following are available run levels
        - 0 -> Halt
        - 1 -> Single user mode
        - 2 -> Multiuser, without NFS (network file system)
        - 3 -> Full multiuser mode (command line interface and not under the graphical user interface) (typically set to this..)
        - 4 -> Unused
        - 5 -> X11 (multiple user mode under graphical user interface) (..or typically set to this)
        - 6 -> Reboot
    - Init identifies the default initlevel from /etc/inittab and uses that to load all appropriate program
    - Execute `grep initdefault /etc/inittab` on your system to identify the default run level
    
    Proof that `/init` has a PID of 1..

6. Runlevel programs [credit](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/02/linux-boot-process/#:~:text=Programs%20starts%20with,started%20before%20sendmail.)
    - When the Linux system is booting up, you might see various services getting started. For example, it might say `"starting sendmail... OK"`. Those are the runlevel programs, executed from the run level directory as defined by your run level.
    - Depending on your default init level setting, the system will execute the programs from one of the following directories.
        - Run level 0 – /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/
        - Run level 1 – /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/
        - Run level 2 – /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/
        - Run level 3 – /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
        - Run level 4 – /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/
        - Run level 5 – /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
        - Run level 6 – /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/
    - Programs starts with S are used during startup. S for startup.
    - Programs starts with K are used during shutdown. K for kill.
    - There are numbers right next to S and K in the program names. Those are the sequence number in which the programs should be started or killed.
    - For example, S12syslog is to start the syslog deamon, which has the sequence number of 12. S80sendmail is to start the sendmail daemon, which has the sequence number of 80. So, syslog program will be started before sendmail.
