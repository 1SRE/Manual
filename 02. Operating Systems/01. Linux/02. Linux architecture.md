<h1 align="center">Linux Architecture</h1></center>

You can break the Linux system architecture into several components; however, the main ones are: hardware, kernel, system libraries, system utilities, desktop environment, and applications layer.

- Hardware layer
    - Represents the physical hardware components of the computer such as the CPU, memory, and storage.
- Kernel layer
    - The kernel is one of the major sections of an OS (operating system). It's responsible for each of the major actions of the Linux OS; the kernel facilitates required abstraction for hiding details of low-level hardware or application programs to the system [credit](https://www.javatpoint.com/architecture-of-linux). Below are some important kernel types which will be referred to later
        - Monolithic kernel
        - Micro kernels
        - Exo kernels
        - Hybrid kernels
    - Ultimately, the kernel is what interacts between the barebone hardware and the rest of the applications found on the OS
- System libraries layer
    - These libraries include system calls which invoke kernel functions as well as other functionst hat perform tasks such as file manipulation, networking, and memory management [credit](https://tecadmin.net/tutorial/linux-architecture)
- System utilities layer
    - Set of programs that perform various system-level tasks such as managing processes, controlling users accounts, and configuring system settings. These utilities are command-line programs that are ran by the user or by other programs
- Desktop environment layer (OPTIONAL)
    - This is optional because it's not available everything (for example, there's the general Ubuntu ISO and there's a Ubuntu server ISO which doesn't have GUI access.. the server is all command-line focused where as the former is an image that you can interact with more physically such as clicking on items)
- Applications layer
    - Topmost layer of the Linux architecture and consists of the software or other applications (i.e.: Google Chrome, VS Code, Docker)

## Kernel Layer - In depth
- Overview
    - The Linux® kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the 2, managing resources as efficiently as possible. The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer.

The kernel has four jobs [credit](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel)
- Memory management
    - Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and where
- Process management
    - Determine which processes can use the central processing unit (CPU), when, and for how long
- Device drivers
    - Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes
- System calls & Security
    - Receive requests for service from the processes
