<h1 align="center">What happens when you visit a site?</h1></center>

# Introduction
Nowadays, visiting websites is as easy as typing in a URL into your preferred browser and hitting enter, but do you know what happens in the background? Hopefully, if you've been following along with the `01. Protocols` document, you'll realize that some of the key components of routing things back to your computer are mentioned there.

Regardless, below are the *steps*:

We'll be utilizing the URL address of the homepage for our application: `https://1sre.io/manual`

# Breakdown
When you enter `https://1sre.io/manual`, there are four components to look at

## Scheme
`https://` is the scheme of our URL. As mentioned in `01. Protocols`, "Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website." This scheme tells the browser to make a connection to the server utilizing TLS (or SSL, remember, TLS is the *new*!).

## Domain
`1sre.io` is the domain of the site. It's easier to remember than the specific IP address (insert IP address later). So how does the broswer know where to pull the IP address from? If you said the DNS, you're right! As mentioned in `01. Protocols`, "The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.".

## Path
The path is what comes after `1sre.io/`, so in this instance, it's `manual`. You can think of the path like the directory system. Common examples of paths are `blog`, `posts`, `tags`, or `images`, each grouping different resources.

## Resource
In theory, there's a resource that we're hitting when we get to that URL. Sometimes you'll see a file extension like `.html` which indicates that the source is a static file on the server with HTML content. If there is no extension, it usually indicates that the server generated the content.

# IP Look up
When hitting `https://1sre.io/manual`, the browser hits a DNS service like Cloudflare's or Google's Public DNS.

There are four components of the DNS endpoint:
1. DNS Recursor
    - The recursor can be thought of as a librarian who is asked to go find a particular book somewhere in a library. The DNS recursor is a server designed to receive queries from client machines through applications such as web browsers. Typically the recursor is then responsible for making additional requests in order to satisfy the clientâ€™s DNS query.
2. Root Nameserver
    - The root server is the first step in translating (resolving) human readable host names into IP addresses. It can be thought of like an index in a library that points to different racks of books - typically it serves as a reference to other more specific locations.
3. TLD Nameserver
    - The top level domain server (TLD) can be thought of as a specific rack of books in a library. This nameserver is the next step in the search for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is "com").
4. Authoritative Nameserver
    - This final nameserver can be thought of as a dictionary on a rack of books, in which a specific name can be translated into its definition. The authoritative nameserver is the last stop in the nameserver query. If the authoritative name server has access to the requested record, it will return the IP address for the requested hostname back to the DNS Recursor (the librarian) that made the initial request.

Typically, most websites you encounter will be cached somewhere in the DNS process. Rather than restating everything mentioned in the `01. Protocols` article, check out the images and video below:

# TCP Connection
Your browser utilizes a TCP connection with the website's server so it can communicate securely over the internet. Using the public Internet routing infrastructure, packets from a client browser request get routed through the router, the ISP, through an internet exchange to switch ISPs or networks, all using transmission control protocol, more commonly known as TCP, to find the server with the IP address to connect to.

When the three-way-handshake is made between the client and the server, the next step is to send the HTTP request to get the page.

# HTTP Request
If you look at the network console when vising `https://1sre.io/manual`, you'll see a bunch of requests being made. Most of the requests will be `GET` requests to retrieve the necessary information for the particular webpage.

The server then responds with a `200 OK` (assuming nothing went wrong with the server) and sends back a response for the client to work with; in this case, it's going to be a JSON data for the website to pull text from.

# Conclusion
After receiving the response from the server, the client (browser) renders the content and makes any additional requets to  get JavaScript, CSS, images, and other kinds of content to produce the rest of the webpage.
