# IP (Interent Protocol)

Method for sending data from one device to another across the internet. Every device has an IP address that uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet.  Today, it’s considered the standard for fast and secure communication directly between mobile devices.

# TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Communication standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. Designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data & messages over networks

TCP guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over the network. 

TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which it ensures remains live until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets, while ensuring data integrity is in place throughout the process.

As a result, high-level protocols that need to transmit data all use TCP Protocol.  Examples include peer-to-peer sharing methods like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Secure Shell (SSH), and Telnet. It is also used to send and receive email through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP), and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and for web access through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

TCP can be an expensive network tool as it includes absent or corrupted packets and protects data delivery with controls like acknowledgments, connection startup, and flow control.

## TCP/IP
TCP/IP divides communication tasks into layers that keep the process standardized, without hardware and software providers doing the management themselves. The data packets must pass through four layers before they are received by the destination device, then TCP/IP goes through the layers in reverse order to put the message back into its original format.

As a connection based protocol, the TCP establishes and maintains a connection between applications or devices until they finish exchanging data. It determines how the original message should be broken into packets, numbers and reassembles the packets, and sends them on to other devices on the network, such as routers, security gateways, and switches, then on to their destination. TCP also sends and receives packets from the network layer, handles the transmission of any dropped packets, manages flow control, and ensures all packets reach their destination.

A good example of how this works in practice is when an email is sent using SMTP from an email server. To start the process, the TCP layer in the server divides the message into packets, numbers them, and forwards them to the IP layer, which then transports each packet to the destination email server. When packets arrive, they are handed back to the TCP layer to be reassembled into the original message format and handed back to the email server, which delivers the message to a user’s email inbox.

TCP/IP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection between a device and a server, which ensures multiple TCP socket connections can be transferred in both directions concurrently. Both the device and server must synchronize and acknowledge packets before communication begins, then they can negotiate, separate, and transfer TCP socket connections.

The four layers of the TCP/IP model are as follows:
1. Datalink layer: The datalink layer defines how data should be sent, handles the physical act of sending and receiving data, and is responsible for transmitting data between applications or devices on a network. This includes defining how data should be signaled by hardware and other transmission devices on a network, such as a computer’s device driver, an Ethernet cable, a network interface card (NIC), or a wireless network. It is also referred to as the link layer, network access layer, network interface layer, or physical layer and is the combination of the physical and data link layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, which standardizes communications functions on computing and telecommunications systems.
2. Internet layer: The internet layer is responsible for sending packets from a network and controlling their movement across a network to ensure they reach their destination. It provides the functions and procedures for transferring data sequences between applications and devices across networks.
3. Transport layer: The transport layer is responsible for providing a solid and reliable data connection between the original application or device and its intended destination. This is the level where data is divided into packets and numbered to create a sequence. The transport layer then determines how much data must be sent, where it should be sent to, and at what rate. It ensures that data packets are sent without errors and in sequence and obtains the acknowledgment that the destination device has received the data packets. Some of the responsibilites of the transport layer are as follows:
    1. End to end delivery
    2. Reliability
    3. Error control
    4. Flow control
    5. Multiplexing & demultiplexing
4. Application layer: The application layer refers to programs that need TCP/IP to help them communicate with each other. This is the level that users typically interact with, such as email systems and messaging platforms. It combines the session, presentation, and application layers of the OSI model.

Real-life examples:

- Text communication
    - We all are aware of the importance of Text Communication in the present times. Any discrepancy in texting between sender and receiver cannot be tolerated. Hence TCP is used in Text Communication due to its reliable transmission, error control, and in order receiving of the data. 
    Example: Whatsapp, Instagram, Google Chat,iMessage.

- FTP (File Transport Protocol)
    - TCP is used in File transfer when we cannot tolerate the loss of data and receiving the data incorrect order is of utmost importance. FTP uses two TCP connections i.e control connection and data connection
        - Control Connection : FTP sends information like user identification and passwords
        - Data Connection: In this connection, files are sent over the network.
    
        Example: FileZilla

- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    - It is used to access the data present on the World Wide Web. It uses TCP protocol for accessing the web pages present on the internet due to the fact that TCP provides inorder data, error control and flow control, and retransmission of data segments.

- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    - It is an application layer protocol that is used to send Emails from one system to another. SMTP uses the services of TCP to start a connection with the SMTP server. Once the SMTP server accepts the connection request, it allows the sender to send the mails. Example: Yahoo, Gmail, Outlook, etc

# UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

Used to establish low-latency connections between applications and decrease transmissions time

UDP does not provide error connection or packet sequencing nor does it signal a destination before it delivers data, which makes it less reliable but less expensive. As such, it is a good option for time-sensitive situations, such as Domain Name System (DNS) lookup, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and streaming media.

Real-life examples:

- Online games
    - Most of the online games we play use the services of User Datagram Protocol. Since any amount of delay cannot be tolerated in online games UDP is widely used over TCP which is quite slower. UDP doesn’t retransmit the lost data and is a connectionless protocol due to which it is much faster.

- Video conferencing
    - Video Conferencing apps like Skype, Gmeet, Zoom, all use the services of UDP due to the fact that they are real-time applications and any delay in receiving the data cannot be tolerated. Examples: Skype, Google, Zoom, FaceTime

- VOIP (Voice over IP)
    - It is similar to Video Conferencing, where apps like Viber, Whatsapp, Google Hangouts use UDP for converting our voice to digital data and transmit it over the network, hence the name VoIP. Examples: WhatsApp Voice, Google Voice

- DNS (Domain Name Systems)
    - It is a service used for mapping domain names to their corresponding IP address. It is used by the application layer. It can also be looked at as a distributed DataBase that has a hierarchical name Server. DNS uses UDP for fetching the corresponding IP address. The DNS is like the yellowpage of website domain names and their respected server IP addresses

# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) & HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

A typical HTTP request contains:
- HTTP version type
    - HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0
- URL
    - http://google.com
- HTTP method
    - The primary or most commonly-used HTTP methods are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These methods correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.
- Request headers
    - ![img](https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/http-request-headers.png)
- (optional) HTTP body
    - The body of a request is the part that contains the ‘body’ of information the request is transferring. The body of an HTTP request contains any information being submitted to the web server, such as a username and password, or any other data entered into a form.

A typical HTTP response contains:
- HTTP status code
    - Indicates the status of the request to the client device. Responses may indicate success, an informational response, a redirect, or errors on the server or client side.
        - Informational responses (100 – 199)
        - Successful responses (200 – 299)
        - Redirection messages (300 – 399)
        - Client error responses (400 – 499)
        - Server error responses (500 – 599)
- Response header
    - Send information about the server and requested resources
- (optional) HTTP body
    - If a request is successful, this contains the requested data in the form of HTML code, which is translated into a web page by the client browser

## HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.

HTTPS uses an encryption protocol to encrypt communications. The protocol is called Transport Layer Security (TLS), although formerly it was known as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protocol secures communications by using what’s known as an asymmetric public key infrastructure. This type of security system uses two different keys to encrypt communications between two parties:
- Private key
    - This key is controlled by the owner of a website and it’s kept, as the reader may have speculated, private. This key lives on a web server and is used to decrypt information encrypted by the public key
- Public key
    - This key is available to everyone who wants to interact with the server in a way that’s secure. Information that’s encrypted by the public key can only be decrypted by the private key.
### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.

If a site has `https` in it's URL, it implemented SSL/TLS

How does it work?
- In order to provide a high degree of privacy, SSL encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that is nearly impossible to decrypt.
- SSL initiates an authentication process called a handshake between two communicating devices (your computer & the website's server) to ensure that both devices are really who they claim to be.
- SSL also digitally signs data in order to provide data integrity, verifying that the data is not tampered with before reaching its intended recipient.

#### What is an SSL certificate?
SSL certificates make SSL/TLS encryption possible, and they contain the website's public key and the website's identity, along with related information. Devices attempting to communicate with the origin server will reference this file to obtain the public key and verify the server's identity. The private key is kept secret and secure.

What does the SSL certificate contain?
- The domain name that the certificate was issued for
- Which person, organization, or device it was issued to
- Which certificate authority issued it
- The certificate authority's digital signature
- Associated subdomains
- Issue date of the certificate
- Expiration date of the certificate
- The public key (the private key is kept secret)

How does a website obtain an SSL certificate?
- For an SSL certificate to be valid, domains need to obtain it from a certificate authority (CA). A CA is an outside organization, a trusted third party, that generates and gives out SSL certificates. The CA will also digitally sign the certificate with their own private key, allowing client devices to verify it. Once the certificate is issued, it needs to be installed and activated on the website's origin server.

"Self-signed SSL certificates are a thing, why does it still say my website is insecure?"
- Technically, anyone can create their own SSL certificate by generating a public-private key pairing and including all the information mentioned above. Such certificates are called self-signed certificates because the digital signature used, instead of being from a CA, would be the website's own private key.
- But with self-signed certificates, there's no outside authority to verify that the origin server is who it claims to be. Browsers don't consider self-signed certificates trustworthy and may still mark sites with one as "not secure," despite the https:// URL. They may also terminate the connection altogether, blocking the website from loading.

### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
SSL and TLS are essentially the same thing, just remember TLS is the *new* and SSL is the *old*.

#### What happens in a TLS handshake?
During the course of a TLS handshake, the client and server together will do the following:

1. Specify which version of TLS (TLS 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) they will use
2. Decide on which cipher suites (see below) they will use
3. Authenticate the identity of the server via the server’s public key and the SSL certificate authority’s digital signature
4. Generate session keys in order to use symmetric encryption after the handshake is complete

The steps of a TLS handshake include:
1. The SSL or TLS client sends a “client hello” message that lists cryptographic information such as the SSL or TLS version and, in the client's order of preference, the CipherSuites supported by the client. The message also contains a random byte string that is used in subsequent computations. The protocol allows for the “client hello” to include the data compression methods supported by the client.
2. The SSL or TLS server responds with a “server hello” message that contains the CipherSuite chosen by the server from the list provided by the client, the session ID, and another random byte string. The server also sends its digital certificate. If the server requires a digital certificate for client authentication, the server sends a “client certificate request” that includes a list of the types of certificates supported and the Distinguished Names of acceptable Certification Authorities (CAs).
3. The SSL or TLS client verifies the server's digital certificate.
4. The SSL or TLS client sends the random byte string that enables both the client and the server to compute the secret key to be used for encrypting subsequent message data. The random byte string itself is encrypted with the server's public key.
5. If the SSL or TLS server sent a “client certificate request”, the client sends a random byte string encrypted with the client's private key, together with the client's digital certificate, or a “no digital certificate alert”. This alert is only a warning, but with some implementations the handshake fails if client authentication is mandatory.
6. The SSL or TLS server verifies the client's certificate.
7. The SSL or TLS client sends the server a “finished” message, which is encrypted with the secret key, indicating that the client part of the handshake is complete.
8. The SSL or TLS server sends the client a “finished” message, which is encrypted with the secret key, indicating that the server part of the handshake is complete.
9. For the duration of the SSL or TLS session, the server and client can now exchange messages that are symmetrically encrypted with the shared secret key.

# DNS (Domain Name System)


# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
The term file transfer protocol (FTP) refers to a process that involves the transfer of files between devices over a network.

Most web browsers come with FTP clients that enable users to transfer files from their computer to a server and vice versa. Some users may want to use a third-party FTP client because many of them offer extra features. Examples of FTP clients that are free to download include FileZilla Client, FTP Voyager, WinSCP, CoffeeCup Free FTP, and Core FTP.

Many people have used FTP before without even realizing it. If you have ever downloaded a file from a web page, you've used FTP. The first step is to log in, which may occur automatically or by manually inputting a username and password. FTP will also require you to access an FTP server through a specific port number. Once you access the FTP server through your FTP client, you can now transfer files. Not all public FTP servers require you to sign in because some servers enable you to access them anonymously.

# SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

An SSH server, by default, listens on the standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 22.

Connecting to a server: `ssh -v nishant@123.456.789.100`

Other executable commands related to SSH:
- `sshd`
    - initiates the SSH server, which waits for incoming SSH connection requests and enables authorized systems to connect to the local host
- `ssh-keygen`
    - is a program to create a new authentication key pair for SSH, which can be used to automate logins, to implement SSO and to authenticate hosts
- `ssh-copy-id`
    - is a program used to copy, install and configure an SSH key on a server to automate passwordless logins and SSO.
- `ssh-agent`
    - is a helper program that tracks identity keys and their passphrases -- from which SSH derives an encryption key -- and enables the user to use the identity keys to log in to different servers without the need to reenter passwords or passphrases.
- `ssh-add`
    - is used to add a key to the SSH authentication agent and is used with ssh-agent to implement SSO using SSH.
- `scp`
    - is a program used for copying files from one computer to another and is an SSH-secured version of rcp.
- `sftp`
    - is a program used to copy files from one computer to another and is an SSH-secured version of ftp, the original File Transfer Protocol. SFTP has become the preferred mechanism for file sharing over the internet, replacing both FTP and FTP/S (FTP Secure), which is a protocol for using FTP over an SSL/TLS tunnel.

# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to any device, or node, on a network so it can communicate using IP. DHCP automates and centrally manages these configurations rather than requiring network administrators to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices. DHCP can be implemented on small local networks, as well as large enterprise networks.

## How DHCP works
It dynamically assigns IP addresses to DHCP clients and allocates TCP/IP configuration information to DHCP clients. This information includes subnet mask information, default gateway IP addresses and domain name system (DNS) addresses.

DHCP is a client-server protocol in which servers manage a pool of unique IP addresses, as well as information about client configuration parameters. The servers then assign addresses out of those address pools. DHCP-enabled clients send a request to the DHCP server whenever they connect to a network.

Clients configured with DHCP broadcast a request to the DHCP server and request network configuration information for the local network to which they're attached. A client typically broadcasts a query for this information immediately after booting up. The DHCP server responds to the client request by providing IP configuration information previously specified by a network administrator. This includes a specific IP address, as well as a time period -- also called a lease -- for which the allocation is valid.

When refreshing an address assignment, a DHCP client requests the same parameters, but the DHCP server may assign a new IP address based on policies set by administrators. DHCP clients can also be configured on an Ethernet interface.

A DHCP server manages a record of all the IP addresses it allocates to network nodes. If a node is relocated in the network, the server identifies it using its media access control (MAC) address, which prevents the accidental configuration of multiple devices with the same IP address. Configuring a DHCP server also requires the creation of a configuration file, which stores network information for clients.

DHCP is not a routable protocol, nor is it a secure one. DHCP is limited to a specific local area network, which means a single DHCP server per LAN is adequate -- or two servers for use in case of a failover. Larger networks might have a wide area network (WAN) that contains multiple individual locations. Depending on the connections between these points and the number of clients in each location, multiple DHCP servers can be set up to handle the distribution of addresses.

If network administrators want a DHCP server to provide addressing to multiple subnets on a given network, they must configure DHCP relay services located on interconnecting routers that DHCP requests have to cross. These agents relay messages between DHCP clients and servers located on different subnets.

DHCP lacks any built-in mechanism that enables clients and servers to authenticate each other. Both are vulnerable to deception -- one computer pretending to be another -- and to attack, where rogue clients can exhaust a DHCP server's IP address pool.

## Components
The DHCP server -- typically either a server or router -- is a networked device that runs on the DHCP service. The DHCP server holds IP addresses, as well as related information pertaining to configuration.

The DHCP client is a device -- such as a computer or phone -- that connects to a network and communicates with a DHCP server.

The DHCP relay manages requests between DHCP clients and servers. Typically, relays are used when an organization has to handle large or complex networks.

[credit1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/DHCP)

## Static vs Dynamic
With dynamic DHCP, a client does not own the IP address assigned to it but instead leases it for a period of time. Each time a device with a dynamic IP address is powered up, it must communicate with the DHCP server to lease another IP address. Wireless devices are examples of clients that are assigned dynamic IP addresses when they connect to a network.

On the other hand, static devices -- such as web servers and switches -- are assigned permanent IP addresses.

# LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate data about organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network -- whether on the public internet or a corporate intranet.

A directory tells the user where in the network something is located. On TCP/IP networks -- including the internet -- the domain name system (DNS) is the directory system used to relate the domain name to a specific network address, which is a unique location on the network. However, the user may not know the domain name. LDAP allows a user to search for an individual without knowing where they're located, although additional information will help with the search.

The most common use of LDAP is to provide a central place for authentication, meaning it stores usernames and passwords. LDAP can then be used in different applications or services to validate users with a plugin. For example, LDAP can be used to validate usernames and passwords with Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, OpenVPN and Linux Samba servers. System administrators can also use LDAP single sign-on to control access to an LDAP database.

LDAP can also be used to add operations into a directory server database, authenticate -- or "bind" -- sessions, delete LDAP entries, search and compare entries using different commands, modify existing entries, extend entries, abandon requests or unbind operations.

## LDAP and Active Directory
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is the protocol that Exchange Server uses to communicate with Active Directory. To really understand what LDAP is and what it does, it is important to understand the basic concept behind Active Directory as it relates to Exchange.

Active Directory is a directory service for managing domains, users and distributed resources such as objects for Windows operating systems. A directory service manages domains and objects while controlling which users have access to each resource. Active Directory is available on Windows Server 2022 and is comprised of multiple services. Services included in Active Directory are Domain, Lightweight Directory, Certificate, Federation and Rights Management services. Each service is included under the Active Directory name to expand directory management capabilities. Active Directory was first previewed in 1999 and has continued to receive updates since then -- including an update with Windows Server 2016 that improved secure Active Directory environments and the ability to migrate Active Directory environments to cloud or hybrid cloud environments.

Active Directory contains information regarding every user account on an entire network. It treats each user account as an object. Each user object also has multiple attributes. An example of an attribute is the user's first name, last name or e-mail address. All this information exists within a huge, cryptic database on a domain controller -- Active Directory. The challenge is to extract information in a usable format. This is LDAP's main job.

LDAP uses a relatively simple, string-based query to extract information from Active Directory. LDAP can store and extract objects such as usernames and passwords in Active Directory and share that object data throughout a network. The nice part is that this all happens behind the scenes. A regular end user will never have to manually perform an LDAP query because Outlook is LDAP-enabled and knows how to perform all the necessary queries on its own.

## LDAP Authentication Process
Consists of the following key players:
- Directory System Agent (DSA)
    - Server running LDAP on its network
- Directory User Agent (DUA)
    - Accesses DSAs as a client (ex: user's PC)
- Distinguished Name (DN)
    - COntains a path through the directory information tree for LDAP to navigate through (ex: cn=Nishant, ou=users, o=Company)
- Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
    - Each component in the path within the DN
- Application Programming Interface (API)
    - A service that lets your app utilize LDAP without knowing the underlying architecture
