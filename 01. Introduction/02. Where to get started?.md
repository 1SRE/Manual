<h1 align="center">Where to get started?</h1></center>

To cut it short, there's no proper way to go about reading the documents found on the website/[GitHub](https://github.com/1SRE/Manual); it's really up to you, the user, to dive anywhere across the vast amount of resources provided to you.

The way I plan on organizing the documents is to cover each topic at a very high level, but also work my way down to the intricacies of each topic (i.e.: starting in Linux in general then going into distrubutions, the Kernel, a typical boot sequence, etc).

As you can tell, the plan is somewhat disorganized for now, but eventually there'll be more consistency throughout the documents.

For the time being, the outline is as follows:

|Topics|
|--|
|Operating Systems|
|CI/CD|
|Networking|
|Scripting|
|Infrastructure as code|
|System Design|
