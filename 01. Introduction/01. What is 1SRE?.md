# What is 1SRE?
1SRE is a platform to learn about anything OS, networking, or other core operational related content for <b>free</b>; the objective of this application is to give college students, experienced professionals, and whomever else the necesseary tools to become a Site Reliability Engineer (or anything similar).

# Why is it called 1SRE?
There are a lot of platforms for (general) software engineers to build their confidence in programming (i.e.: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/), etc); however, there's nothing that covers concepts about OS (operating systems), the Kernel, networks (TCP/UDP/POP/FTP/etc), Ansible, CI/CD, and other buzz words in operational roles. Sure, it's possible to find manuals that cover each of these topics in depth by simply Googling them, but the purpose of 1SRE is to combine everything and spit it out onto one <i>source of truth</i>.

# Truth
Originally, this platform was going to be a personal project that wasn't accessible to anyone else; however, I decided to make it publically available because I realized that I was once a clueless wanna-be SRE. There was no *source of truth* that I could turn to and I didn't want another student or professional to be as lost as I was.

If you find anything that needs to be corrected, please submit a PR request and I'll look at it when I get the chance. Whatever I write about is through experience or research, but I know with technology constantly changing, there's always something new that could be added or even altered to an article.

# Thank you
Thank you so much for giving this a read. I'm excited to work on this platform moving forward and I hope to make a significant impact within the [community](https://discord.gg/7Jv879QhKM).
