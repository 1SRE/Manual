The plan for now is to create documents and setup a pipeline to automatically display them as intended on 1SRE's website (at the time of writing, the domain hasn't been purchased yet ðŸ˜¬... If it does get purchased, I'll just think of another name and go with that)

Future plans consist of:
- Video demonstrations
- Free labs
- Premium features
- Discord community
- Please make a PR with more things that I can write here.. credit will be given ðŸ˜›
