<h1 align="center">What is Git?</h1></center>

Directly from [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/)
> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

Honestly, I don't plan on adding much to this subfolder. I use Git 99.9% of the time at work and most of the commands are muscle memory at this point; however, there are still some commands I simply don't use b/c I never found them to be useful (i.e.: `git rebase`)
