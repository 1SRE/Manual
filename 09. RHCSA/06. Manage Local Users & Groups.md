# Introduction
- Root user is UID 0
- Can always rename root user to another account (i.e.: admin)
- Users can be organized into groups
- Just b/c the user is part of the root group doesn't make the user be able to run everything a root user can do-- permissions are dependent on user id's role, not group's
- all users have a group named after themselves
    - all users are a member of their own group

|Permissions|links|user who owns file|group that owns the file|Size|Month|Day|Time|file|
|-----------|-|----------|----------|--|----|---|------|----|
|-rwxrwxrwx |1| nishi7409| nishi7409| 0| May|  2| 15:25| foo|

- user that creates the file is automatically the owner of the file
- owning group is automatically set to primary group of the user that created the file

1. UID 0:
    1. The superuser (root) account UID.

1. UID 1-200:
    1. System account UIDs statically assigned to system processes.

1. UID 201-999:
    1. UIDs assigned to system processes that do not own files on this system. Software that requires an unprivileged UID is dynamically assigned UID from this available pool.

1. UID 1000+:
    1. The UID range to assign to regular, unprivileged users.

- user account info => /etc/passwd
    |username|password (no longer a thing in rhel9+)|user id|user groups|description|directory to home folder|user's shell|
    |-----------|-|----------|----------|--|--|--|
    |student:|x:|1000:|1000:|student user:|/home/student:|/bin/bash|

- group account info => /etc/group
    |group's name|password (no longer a thing in rhel9+)|group id|members of the group|
    |-----------|-|----------|----------|
    |wheel:|x:|10:|student:|


# Gaining superuser access
- `whoami` prints out username
- `id` gives a lot of information
    - uid=1000(student) gid=1000(student) groups=1000(student),10(wheel)
        - uid=uid(1000) = user id
        - gid=1000(student) = primary group
        - groups=1000(student),10(wheel) = additional groups user is attached to

**SUDO CONFIG ONLY** - Get permissions for a group by looking at `/etc/sudoers/` (main configuration file for the `sudo` command)
- grep wheel /etc/sudoers/
    |user or group name (%=group)|loggining in from location/can run commands as any user|what users in a group can run a command|

- To enable full sudo access for the user01 user, you can create the /etc/sudoers.d/user01 file with the following content:
    - user01        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
- To enable full sudo access for the group01 group, you can create the /etc/sudoers.d/group01 file with the following content:
    - %group01        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
- To enable users in the games group to run the id command as the operator user, you can create the /etc/sudoers.d/games file with the following content:
    - %games ALL=(operator) /bin/id
- You can also set up sudo to allow a user to run commands as another user without entering their password, by using the NOPASSWD: ALL command:
    - ansible        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL



# commands!
- `id <username>`
    - tells us if a user is in the system
- `getent passwd <username>`
    - looks up username in another identity provider (IDM (red hat thing), microsoft active directory, etc)

- `useradd <username`
    - adds user to system and chooses the next available user id starting at 1000
- `useradd -u <username>`
    - specify the user id for the new user!
- `usermod -g wheel ricardo`
    - -g will change the primary group
    - wheel is the name of the new primary group that we'll be changing for user, ricardo
- `usermod -G wheel ricardo`
    - -G will add wheel to the supplemental groups of user ricardo (but you have to comma separate each group name to add multiple supplemental groups)
- `usermod -aG wheel ricardo`
    - -aG will add supplemental groups on top of what alredy exists for the user (literally appending new group data without having to restate older group names)
- `userdel ricardo`
    - will delete user but not their home directory
        - when new user is added, that new user takes over ownership of the files that were previously owned by ricardo
- `userdel -r ricardo`
    - will delete user AND their home directory
- `find / -nouser -o -nogroup 2>/dev/null`
    - finds all files/directories that have no owning user/group and bad output is sent to hell (it's not shown in terminal)
- `useradd ben`
    - creates user
    - then run `passwd -S ben`
        - show password status of user `ben`
    - `passwd ben`
        - will allow us to change the password for the user
- instead of deleting users, you can lock users via: `usermod -L <username>`
    - `passwd -S <username>`
        - will say user is locked!

# manage local group accounts
- `groupadd <group name>`
    - creates new group!
- `groupadd -g <gid> <group name>`
    - creates a new group with a specified gid number
- `groupadd -r <group name>`
    - creates sytstem groups.. as with normal groups, system groups use a GID from the range of listed valid system GIDs in the `/etc/login.defs` file
- `groupmod -n <new group name> <old group name>`
    - renames group
- `groupmod -g <new group id> <group name>`
    - modifies the group's id so it's the one specified
- if you want to change your primary group temporarily use the
    - `newgrp <group name` command!
        - You can temporarily switch your primary group to another group, but you can only choose from supplementary groups to which you already belong. You might switch if you are about to create a number of new files, manually or scripted, and want them to have a different group assigned as owner as they are being created.
    - this is temporary b/c when you log out and log back in, it'll revert back to your old group

# manage user passwords
- password info => /etc/shadow
    |username|password hash (divided into three components, each component prefixed with a `$` (the first is the hashing algorithm #, the second is the salt, and the third is the user's password hash)|number of days since epoch (01/01/1970 at 12AM)|# of days to wait before password can be changed|the amount of days until the password expires|# of days before password expires|inactivity period (specifies how long we can login for while the password is expired)|when the account expires|The last field is typically empty and reserved for future use.|
    |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
    |user03|$6$CSsXsd3rwghsdfarf|17933|0|99999|7|2|18113|-|
- to change aging info for a password is donevia `chage` command
    - `chage -m 0 -M 60 -W 7 -I 5 -E 2022-12-31 ricardo`
        - -m 0 = is the minimum amount of days before the user can change the password
        - -M 60 = maximum num of days a user's password expires after setting it
        - -W 7 = 7 day warning before password expires
        - -I 5 = user can login to account 5 days after password expires before they can't/r required to change the password
        - -E 5 = setting account expiration
        - ricardo = user who we're running the command on
- `passwd -S ricardo`
    - spits out ricardo's password info (expiration, if account is locked or not, etc)
- if you want to force user to change their password, run: `chage -d 0 username`
    - expiring user password ASAP!
- password defaults located @ `/etc/login.defs`
- sometimes we want to create accounts that aren't used by people
    - `useradd -c "pastebin app" -s /sbin/nologin pastebin`
        - -c = commenting that this user is for the pastebin app
        - -s = set shell to default
        - `/sbin/nologin` = this is the shell so no one can login to it!
        - pastebin = pastebin account
        - no one will be able to successfully login to user

**this is a hard chapter, don't feel bad**
