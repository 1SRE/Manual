# Introduction
1. `/boot`
    - Files to start the boot process.
1. `/dev`
    - Special device files that the system uses to access hardware.
1. `/etc`
    - System-specific configuration files.
1. `/home`
    - Home directory for regular user
1. `/root`
    - Home directory for the administrative superuser, root.
1. `/run`
    - Runtime data for processes that started since the last boot. This data includes process ID files and lock files. The contents of this directory are re-created on reboot. This directory consolidates the /var/run and /var/lock directories from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
1. `/tmp`
    - A world-writable space for temporary files. Files that are not accessed, changed, or modified for 10 days are deleted from this directory automatically. The /var/tmp directory is also a temporary directory, in which files that are not accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.
1. `/usr`
    - Installed software, shared libraries, including files, and read-only program data. Significant subdirectories include:
        - `/usr/bin:` User commands

        - `/usr/sbin:` System administration commands

        - `/usr/local:` Locally customized software
1. `/var`
    - System-specific variable data should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content, might be found under /var.

1. Processes
    - Process IDs (PIDs)
1. Users
    - User IDs (UIDs)
1. Groups
    - Group IDs (GIDs)
1. Files
    - Index nodes (inodes)

- inodes
    - Keep track of everything except the name of the file
    - File system specific
    - XFS system (default for RHEL)
        - 512 bytes/file
        - as you create the file, an inode is created automatically
    - ownership, permissions, date and time stamps, paths to data blocks containing file data
- file allocation table
    - name of the file
    - inode associated to file

- Hard links can not link directories, only files!
    - `ln something something`
- Symbolic link can link directories
    - `ln -s folder1 folder2`
