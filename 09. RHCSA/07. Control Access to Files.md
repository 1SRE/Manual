# Introduction
- 6 permissions
    - 3 regular
    - 3 special

## 3 regular permissions
Everything (including directories) are files

Each file has 10 permission bits

|File type|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|---------|------------|------------|-----|
|-|---|---|---|
|-|use `chown` to change permissions|use `chown` or `chgrp` to change permissions|---|

- `r`ead
- `w`write
- `x`ecute

|File type|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|---------|------------|------------|-----|
|d|rwx|r-x|---|
|Directory|read/write/execute|read/-/xecute|no permissions|
|Directory|cd into directory, write files into directory, and execute commands in directory|cd into directory and only execute commands in directory|literally not allowed to do anything :(|

1. Is the user in question the owning user of the file?
    1. If yes, the permissions for the owning user apply
    1. If no, go to 2
1. Is the user in question a member of the owning group associated with the file?
    1. If yes, the permissions for the owning group apply
    1. If no, go to 3
1. The permissions for other apply

## To check permissions
```shell
ls -l <file>
```

### File types
- `-` is a regular file
- `d` is a directory
- `l` is a symbolic link
- `c` is a character device file
- `b` is a block device file
- `p` is a named pipe file
- `s` is a local socket file

## Managing file system permissions from CLI
```shell
chmod
```
changes the file and directory permissions!

`chmod` can be read as "change mode" because the mode of a file is another name for file permissions

```shell
chmod who/what/which file|directory
```

- who = the class of the user
    - u = user = the filw owner
    - g = group = member of the file's group
    - o = other = users who are not the file owner nor members of the file's group
    - a = all = all the three previous groups
- what = operator that modifies the *which*
    - `+` = add = adds the permission to the file
    - `-` = remove = removes the permission to the file
    - `=` = set exactly = sets exactly the provided permission to the file
- which = the mode
    - r = read
    - w = write
    - x = e**x**ecute

- or just stick to numbers because it's easier!

```shell
chmod ### file/directory/whatever
```

### Permissions can be expressed octally
- read (r)
    - 4 bits
- write (w)
    - 2 bits
- xecute (x)
    - 1 bit

- It's simply about adding numbers togethers
    - Strictly read permissions -> 4
    - Strictly write permissions -> 2
    - Strictly execute permissions -> 1
    - Strictly read and write permissions -> 6
    - Strictly read and execute permissions -> 5
    - Read, write, and execute permissions -> 7

|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|------------|------------|-----|
|7|1|3|
|Read/write/xecute permissions|Execute permissions|Write and eecute permissions|
|7|0|0|
|Read/write/xecute permissions given|no permissions|no permissions|

## Change File and Directory User or Group Ownership
```shell
chown student file/directory
```

or change owner and group by
```shell
chown owner:group file/directory
```

or use the following to simply change the group
```shell
chgrp group file/directory
```

## 3 special permissions
So we've covered basic user, group, and other types of permissions; however, there is something called special permissions (the fourth permission type). Special permissions provide additional access-related features beyond what the basic permission types allow

|Permissions|Effects on files|Effects on directories|
|-|-|-|
|u+s (suid)|File executes as the user that owns the file, not as the user that ran the file.|No effect|
|g+s (sgid)|File executes as the group that owns the file.|Files that are created in the directory have a group owner to match the group owner of the directory.|
|o+t (sticky)|No effect|Users with write access to the directory can remove only files that they own; they cannot remove or force saves to files that other users own.
|

- Sticky bit (directories only)
    - only the owning user can delete a file from a directory
    - `chmod o+t` or `chmod 1NNN` (i.e.: `chmod 1777`)
    - identified in permissions for other
- SetGID bit (files and directories)
    - the owning group of a newly created file is derived from the directory that the file is created in (for directories)
    - executables run permissions of the owning group of the execltuable (for files)
    - `chmod g+s /dir` or `chmod 2NNN /dir`
    - `chmod g+s /file` or `chmod 2NNN /file`
    - Identified in permissions for owning groups
