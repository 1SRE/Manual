# Introduction
- 6 permissions
    - 3 regular
    - 3 special

## 3 regular permissions
Everything (including directories) are files

Each file has 10 permission bits

|File type|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|---------|------------|------------|-----|
|-|---|---|---|
||use `chown` to change permissions|use `chown` or `chgrp` to change permissions||

- `r`ead
- `w`write
- `x`ecute

|File type|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|---------|------------|------------|-----|
|d|rwx|r-x|---|
|Directory|read/write/execute|read/-/xecute|no permissions|
|Directory|cd into directory, write files into directory, and execute commands in directory|cd into directory and only execute commands in directory|literally not allowed to do anything :(|

1. Is the user in question the owning user of the file?
    1. If yes, the permissions for the owning user apply
    1. If no, go to 2
1. Is the user in question a member of the owning group associated with the file?
    1. If yes, the permissions for the owning group apply
    1. If no, go to 3
1. The permissions for other apply

### Permissions can be expressed octally

- read (r)
    - 4 bits
- write (w)
    - 2 bits
- xecute (x)
    - 1 bit

If you want to give an entity read, write, and execute permissions then the number is **7**
|Owning User|Owning Group|Other (everyone else who isn't the owner and group)|
|------------|------------|-----|
|7|7|7|
|Read/write/xecute permissions given|Read/write/xecute permissions given|Read/write/xecute permissions given|
|7|0|0|
|Read/write/xecute permissions given|no permissions|no permissions|

## 3 special permissions
- Sticky bit (directories only)
    - only the owning user can delete a file from a directory
    - `chmod o+t` or `chmod 1NNN` (i.e.: `chmod 1777`)
    - identified in permissions for other
- SetGID bit (files and directories)
    - the owning group of a newly created file is derived from the directory that the file is created in (for directories)
    - executables run permissions of the owning group of the execltuable (for files)
    - `chmod g+s /dir` or `chmod 2NNN /dir`
    - `chmod g+s /file` or `chmod 2NNN /file`
    - Identified in permissions for owning groups
